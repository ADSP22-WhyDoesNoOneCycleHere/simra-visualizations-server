# SimRa Visualization

## Project Architecture

This project consists of three components:

- [**importer:**](https://github.com/KrokodileDandy/simra-visualizations-server/tree/develop/importer) Import csv files, generated by the SimRa smartphone applications into an postgreSQL database.
- [**api:**](https://github.com/KrokodileDandy/simra-visualizations-server/tree/develop/api) Provide RESTful functionality.
- [**simra-frontend:**](https://github.com/KrokodileDandy/simra-visualizations-server/tree/develop/simra-frontend) A Vue.js application to allow for interaction with the data.

The following components are also needed:

- [**Tirex:**](https://github.com/openstreetmap/tirex) A tileserver which renders tiles as PNGs which then can be served to the frontend.
- **postgreSQL:** The database.
- [**Graphhopper:**](https://github.com/graphhopper/map-matching) Provides functionality to map match GPS data and to find the shortest route between two paths.
